            <p><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> recently gave an awesome talk  titled <a href="http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/david-heinemeier-hansson-at-startup-school-08">The secret to making money online</a> at the <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> Startup School.  Aside from being entertaining, David keeps hammering at the VC-fueled dreams of today&#8217;s web entrepreneurs.  David has been at this for a long time, and what he is saying is <em>obvious</em> and <em>common-sense</em> (and David will tell you so).</p>&#x000A;<p>And yet, we always hear people talking about the <strong>Money Maker</strong>, or how they are going to target 1% of a <strong>$10 billion industry</strong>, or other self-defeating filters.  If you find yourself uttering those kind of phrases in response to your own ideas or the ideas of others, <strong>stop</strong>.</p>&#x000A;<p>Refocus on what the idea is, and evaluate it on its merits.  Thinking about how to build a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_yahoo_microsoft_gym.php">GYM</a> acquisition or targeting a market that will attract $10 million in VC funding is a waste of your time.</p>&#x000A;<p>Should you ignore pricing and profits?  Maybe; if you do look at them, examine them in a reasonable context &#8212; what do I need to just run the service on a minimal server?  With no paid staff?  With minimal time commitments?  How would it look like if I had 100 customers?  1000 customers?</p>&#x000A;<p>Yes, this means you are no longer playing in the VC startup space<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  Cool.  If you really want to play there, you will be <strong>much</strong> better off playing there after you already have those 100 customers.</p>&#x000A;<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I am unsure about investors like Y Combinator, as they <em>seem</em> to be advocates for this way of thinking.</p>

            <p>Recently when looking through some plugin&#8217;s code, we found the following line:</p>&#x000A;<p><script src='http://gist.github.com/38693.js'></script></p>&#x000A;<p>This <em>seems</em> to be an acceptable variant of the commonly used</p>&#x000A;<p><script src='http://gist.github.com/38695.js'></script></p>&#x000A;<p>As you may have surmised, it is not an acceptable variant.  This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_programming">Voodoo programming</a> smell, as it indicates a misunderstanding of exactly what the semantics of <code>send</code> are.  There is also a clearer, more intention revealing, and identical<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> alternative <code>include Foo</code> or with the omitted parenthesis <code>include(Foo)</code> .</p>&#x000A;<p>This of course, leads us to why <code>ActiveRecord::Base.send(:include, Foo)</code> is acceptable.  The <code>include</code> method is private, so the most elegant way to invoke it on <em>another</em> object is by using <code>send</code>; this is possible because <code>send</code> ignores access control allowing us to invoke <code>include</code> directly.</p>&#x000A;<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> <em>Almost</em>, the difference is that <code>send</code> is in the call stack.</p>

            <p>Last week, <b>RSpec 1.1.4</b> was released; and given my optimistic disposition I immediately upgraded.  Happily, the upgrade was almost seamless.  Two interdependent issues kept this from being a flawless upgrade:</p>&#x000A;<ol>&#x000A;	<li>A new deprecation warning on our helper specs (<em>no one really likes to see deprecation warnings</em>)</li>&#x000A;	<li>A bug in the new way to write helper specs (<em>a show stopper</em>)</li>&#x000A;</ol>&#x000A;<p>Lets see what happens when we run our spec<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>&#x000A;<pre><code>Wonderland$ spec spec/helpers/dog_helper_spec.rb &#x000A;Modules will no longer be automatically included in RSpec version 1.1.4.  Called from ./spec/helpers/dog_helper_spec.rb:8&#x000A;.Modules will no longer be automatically included in RSpec version 1.1.4.  Called from ./spec/helpers/dog_helper_spec.rb:16&#x000A;.&#x000A;Finished in 0.393129 seconds&#x000A;2 examples, 0 failures</code></pre>&#x000A;<p>Lets examine the helper spec that generated these warnings:</p>&#x000A;<p><script src='http://gist.github.com/38679.js'></script></p>&#x000A;<p>So, what does this deprecation warning tell us?  We are being warned that calls to <strong>name_or_description</strong> and <strong>owner_link</strong>, which are called on the implicit <strong>self</strong> of the RSpec <em>it</em> blocks, are going to fail in the future when the helper module (<strong>DogHelper</strong> in this example) is no longer automatically included by RSpec.</p>&#x000A;<p>Or put another way, calling helper methods like <strong>name_or_description</strong> directly, <em>exactly as one might in a view</em>, will no longer work.</p>&#x000A;<p>The new way to call helper methods is through the <strong>helper</strong> attribute of RSpec, giving access to an <code>ActionView::Base</code> instance with the helper module included.  Lets go ahead and make this change to our two helper calls:</p>&#x000A;<p><script src='http://gist.github.com/38681.js'></script></p>&#x000A;<p>Lets try this out!</p>&#x000A;<pre><code>Wonderland$ spec spec/helpers/dog_helper_spec.rb &#x000A;.F&#x000A;1) NoMethodError in 'DogHelper owner_link() should return a link to the owner'&#x000A;You have a nil object when you didn't expect it!&#x000A;The error occurred while evaluating nil.url_for&#x000A;(eval):17:in `user_path'&#x000A;/Users/leshill/src/rails/rspec114/app/helpers/dog_helper.rb:9:in `owner_link'&#x000A;./spec/helpers/dog_helper_spec.rb:16:&#x000A;Finished in 0.398686 seconds&#x000A;2 examples, 1 failure</code></pre>&#x000A;<p>Hmmm, we have gotten rid of the deprecation warnings, but we now have a new (and truly unexpected!) failure.</p>&#x000A;<p>This is a bona-fide bug in 1.1.4, and might lead to our having to rollback to 1.1.3 if there was no easy workaround.  Thankfully, there is a fix already available for 1.1.5 , and that fix can be easily adapted within our own specs.</p>&#x000A;<p>Lets add this <strong>before</strong> block to our spec:</p>&#x000A;<p><script src='http://gist.github.com/38683.js'></script></p>&#x000A;<p>And then try it out:</p>&#x000A;<pre><code>Wonderland$ spec spec/helpers/dog_helper_spec.rb &#x000A;..&#x000A;Finished in 0.40663 seconds&#x000A;2 examples, 0 failures</code></pre>&#x000A;<p>Much better!</p>&#x000A;<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I am using a mock spec to demonstrate the issue, the minimal Rails app which fits around this spec is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
