<p><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> recently gave an awesome talk  titled <a href="http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/david-heinemeier-hansson-at-startup-school-08">The secret to making money online</a> at the <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> Startup School.  Aside from being entertaining, David keeps hammering at the VC-fueled dreams of today&#8217;s web entrepreneurs.  David has been at this for a long time, and what he is saying is <em>obvious</em> and <em>common-sense</em> (and David will tell you so).</p>
<p>And yet, we always hear people talking about the <strong>Money Maker</strong>, or how they are going to target 1% of a <strong>$10 billion industry</strong>, or other self-defeating filters.  If you find yourself uttering those kind of phrases in response to your own ideas or the ideas of others, <strong>stop</strong>.</p>
<p>Refocus on what the idea is, and evaluate it on its merits.  Thinking about how to build a <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_yahoo_microsoft_gym.php">GYM</a> acquisition or targeting a market that will attract $10 million in VC funding is a waste of your time.</p>
<p>Should you ignore pricing and profits?  Maybe; if you do look at them, examine them in a reasonable context &#8212; what do I need to just run the service on a minimal server?  With no paid staff?  With minimal time commitments?  How would it look like if I had 100 customers?  1000 customers?</p>
<p>Yes, this means you are no longer playing in the VC startup space<sup class="footnote"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.  Cool.  If you really want to play there, you will be <strong>much</strong> better off playing there after you already have those 100 customers.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I am unsure about investors like Y Combinator, as they <em>seem</em> to be advocates for this way of thinking.</p>
