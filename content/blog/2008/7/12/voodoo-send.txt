Recently when looking through some plugin's code, we found the following line:

gist38693.

This _seems_ to be an acceptable variant of the commonly used

gist38695.

As you may have surmised, it is not an acceptable variant.  This is a "Voodoo programming":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_programming smell, as it indicates a misunderstanding of exactly what the semantics of @send@ are.  There is also a clearer, more intention revealing, and identical[1] alternative @include Foo@ or with the omitted parenthesis @include(Foo)@ .

This of course, leads us to why @ActiveRecord::Base.send(:include, Foo)@ is acceptable.  The @include@ method is private, so the most elegant way to invoke it on _another_ object is by using @send@; this is possible because @send@ ignores access control allowing us to invoke @include@ directly.

fn1. _Almost_, the difference is that @send@ is in the call stack.
