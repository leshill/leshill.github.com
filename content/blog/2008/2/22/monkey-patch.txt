So after missing the wisdom[1] of this:

"http://xkcd.com/386":http://xkcd.com/386

And responding to this:

"http://b.lesseverything.com/2008/2/19/haml-doesn-t-like-javascript":http://b.lesseverything.com/2008/2/19/haml-doesn-t-like-javascript

I went to bed.

This morning I wrote my first **Rails** (really **Haml**) __Monkey Patch__[2].  This adds some of what Steve wanted: undisturbed inline javascript with variable interpolation.  I am not sure what else he wanted as I did not read his blog carefully :)

Throw this into @lib/inline_javascript.rb@

gist33531.

Throw this at the bottom of your @environment.rb@, taken from here "http://groups.google.com/group/haml/msg/2d890cf1ede761ea":http://groups.google.com/group/haml/msg/2d890cf1ede761ea

gist33532.

And then do this in your **Haml** file:

gist33533.

h2. Update

I decided to make a patch and submit it to the **Haml** folks directly.  This gave me the 'opportunity' to get **git** going.

Nathan Weizenbaum took the time to put in a more comprehensive fix to expose the interpolation functionality to all filters -- look for it in an upcoming release.

fn1. It's turtles all the way down.

fn2. You do not want to know what my subconscious originally thought up as the way to do this -- that was twisted.
