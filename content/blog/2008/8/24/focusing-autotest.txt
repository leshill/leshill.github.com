The usual "autotest":http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest workflow goes something like this:

* Edit and save
* Autotest runs associated specs
* Are there failures?  Fix and start over
* Autotest runs the entire suite

Sometimes though, you want autotest to just ignore most of your specs and focus on a few specs.

Last week, while Kevin, Rick, and Yossef  ("OG":http://bl.ogtastic.com) were here, they  shared an autotest tweak that does exactly that.

The tweak allows you to specify a regular expression to limit the files which autotest watches; for example, to autotest only files matching @*user*.rb@ you would start autotest like so (_atest_ is an alias):

bc. % atest user

Here is the (lightly modified) code to do this; in your @.autotest@ file add:

gist38700.

And in your @.bash_profile@ add:

gist38702.

Now use the alias to invoke autotest.  For standard autotest behavior:

bc. % atest

To limit what autotest is watching, pass a regular expression (which can be a simple string):

bc. % atest user.*html
