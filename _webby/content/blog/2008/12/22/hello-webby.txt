As of this post, I am using publishing *Wonderland* with "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org .

Some of the things I like about *Webby*:

* desktop based -- updates are made on my laptop, giving me a wider choice of tools for writing this blog [1][2]
* static pages -- the blog site is served from *Apache* as pure html files, there is no requirement to run a blogging server [3]
* extensible -- *Webby* can be extended both with rake tasks and Ruby code[4]

fn1. Yes, this explains why I have not written a post recently.

fn2. This post was edited with MacVim.

fn3. I know, old school, some "folks":http://www.nedbatchelder.com have been publishing this way for a long time.

fn4. Easy! A one-liner "gist":http://gist.github.com filter.

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
Webby::Filters.register :gist { |input| input.gsub(/gist(\d+)\./) { |s| "<script src='http://gist.github.com/#{$1}.js'></script>" } }
</coderay>
