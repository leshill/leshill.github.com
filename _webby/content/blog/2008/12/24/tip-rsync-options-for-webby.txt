If you are making substantial changes to your "Webby":http://github.com/TwP/based site, you will have no doubt noticed that deleted files are not automatically removed from the @output@ directory or the deploy server.

Use the following @Sitefile@ to:

* clear the output directory
* build the site
* deploy the site with *rsync* with the checksum and delete options[1][2]

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
SITE.host = 'HOST'
# use delete and checksum through ssh
SITE.rsync_args = ['-r', '-c', '--delete', '--rsh=ssh']
SITE.remote_dir = '/SOME/DIR'


task :default => :build

desc 'deploy the site to the webserver'
task :deploy => [:clobber, :build, 'deploy:rsync']
</coderay>
</notextile>

fn1. *Rsync* will only update changed files, and will detect deleted files.

fn2. Using the @--delete@ option will remove files from your deploy server; if you have mixed your *Webby* content with server-only files[3], you should not use this.

fn3. You may want to reconsider doing that.
