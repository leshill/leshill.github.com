If you are making substantial changes to your "Webby":http://github.com/TwP/based site, you will have no doubt noticed that deleted files are not automatically removed from the @output@ directory or the deploy server.

Use the following @Sitefile@ to:

* clear the output directory
* build the site
* deploy the site with *rsync* with the checksum and delete options[1][2]

gist39827.

fn1. *Rsync* will only update changed files, and will detect deleted files.

fn2. Using the @--delete@ option will remove files from your deploy server; if you have mixed your *Webby* content with server-only files[3], you should not use this.

fn3. You may want to reconsider doing that.
