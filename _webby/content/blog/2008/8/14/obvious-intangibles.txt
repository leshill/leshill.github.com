"Seth Godin":http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog has just put up a fantastic post on "The intangibles":http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/08/the-intangibles.html -- ways to set your product or service apart.

Many of them read as _common-sense_ or _obvious_, but like most _common-sense_ and _obvious_ advice, it is rarely actually practiced; often the advice is even actively dismissed with an annoyed 'Of course we do that!' -- only you do not do that, and you are fooling yourself by saying so.

Take stock of what you are doing, and ask yourself if you are really doing the _common-sense_ and _obvious_ things.
