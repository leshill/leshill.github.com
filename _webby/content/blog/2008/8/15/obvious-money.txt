"David Heinemeier Hansson":http://www.loudthinking.com recently gave an awesome talk  titled "The secret to making money online":http://www.omnisio.com/startupschool08/david-heinemeier-hansson-at-startup-school-08 at the "Y Combinator":http://ycombinator.com Startup School.  Aside from being entertaining, David keeps hammering at the VC-fueled dreams of today's web entrepreneurs.  David has been at this for a long time, and what he is saying is _obvious_ and _common-sense_ (and David will tell you so).

And yet, we always hear people talking about the *Money Maker*, or how they are going to target 1% of a *$10 billion industry*, or other self-defeating filters.  If you find yourself uttering those kind of phrases in response to your own ideas or the ideas of others, *stop*.

Refocus on what the idea is, and evaluate it on its merits.  Thinking about how to build a "GYM":http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_yahoo_microsoft_gym.php acquisition or targeting a market that will attract $10 million in VC funding is a waste of your time.

Should you ignore pricing and profits?  Maybe; if you do look at them, examine them in a reasonable context -- what do I need to just run the service on a minimal server?  With no paid staff?  With minimal time commitments?  How would it look like if I had 100 customers?  1000 customers?

Yes, this means you are no longer playing in the VC startup space[1].  Cool.  If you really want to play there, you will be *much* better off playing there after you already have those 100 customers.

fn1. I am unsure about investors like Y Combinator, as they _seem_ to be advocates for this way of thinking.
