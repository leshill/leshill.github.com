There are some rumblings in the Ruby community now about the recently released "Diaspora":http://www.joindiaspora.com/ and the quality of its codebase.

I took a look at it on the day it was released. What I saw was everyone's first Rails app. The code looked like it had been written directly after reading a tutorial or a book.

This is not a bad thing. We all started with Rails and wrote an app like that.  It is the first step on the journey to mastery.

Unfortunately for the Diaspora team, they have done this in public and with a great expectations and corresponding hype (Diaspora has been called a _Facebook Killer_).

Fortunately for the Diaspora team, they have done this in public with a "github repository":http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora that others can contribute to[1] and make better.

fn1. Sort of. I, and others, would have preferred an MIT license.
