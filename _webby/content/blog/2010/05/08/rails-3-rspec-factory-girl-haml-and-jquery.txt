Easily generate a Rails 3 application with RSpec, Factory Girl, Haml, and jQuery in one line:

bc. % rails new my_app -J -T -m \
    http://github.com/leshill/rails3-app/raw/master/app.rb

h2. rvm

We love @rvm@, so the application has an @.rvmrc@ generated to specify a gemset.

h2. Generators

This also gives you the Factory Girl and Haml Rails 3 generators &mdash; the generators for RSpec are in the RSpec gem &mdash; so that your factories and views are generated using Factory Girl and Haml, and that all your generated tests are specs. These generators are from the *rails3_generators* gem, we pulled them out to avoid all the other dependencies included in that gem.

h2. JavaScript Includes

Since the Rails helper @javascript_include_tag :defaults@ is looking for Prototype, we used "this":http://flow.handle.it/past/2010/2/9/jquery_in_rails to add a new JavaScript expansion to pull in the jQuery libraries. Use it like so:

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
  = javascript_include_tag :jquery
</coderay>
</notextile>

h2. git

We love @git@, so the application has a git repo initialized with all the initial changes staged.

h2. Wrap Up

After the application has been generated, there are a few clean up commands to run:

bc.   % cd my_app
  % gem install bundler
  % bundle install
  % bundle lock
  % script/rails generate rspec:install
