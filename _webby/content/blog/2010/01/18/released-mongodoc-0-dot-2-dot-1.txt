I just released "MongoDoc":http://github.com/leshill/mongodoc v0.2.1, with mongodb 1.3 and partial update support.

h2. What is it?

MongoDoc is a simple and easy to use ActiveRecord-like object mapper for "mongoDB":http://www.mongodb.org in Ruby.

MongoDoc is _also_ an extension of the "Mongo Ruby Driver":http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver making it a snap to get Ruby in and out of mongoDB.

MongoDoc is *not* ActiveRecord for mongoDB.  We do not have callbacks, nor do we have dynamic finders.  We do have associations, named scopes, and other features.

MongoDoc *is* simple, easy-to-use, and fast. And it works with Rails (2.3.x at the moment, 3 soonish?).

MongoDoc is designed to work with document data, if you are looking to map relational data in mongoDB, you will have to look elsewhere.

h2. Ruby objects in mongoDB

Lets just get right into it and save some Ruby objects in mongoDB!

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
class Contact
  attr_accessor :name, :addresses, :interests
end

class Address
  attr_accessor :street, :city, :state, :zip, :phone_number
end
</coderay>
</notextile>

With MongoDoc, instead of saving JSON[1], we can save an object directly:

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
contact = Contact.new
contact.name = 'Hashrocket'
contact.interests = ['ruby', 'rails', 'agile']

address = Address.new
address.street = '320 First Street North, #712'
address.city = 'Jacksonville Beach'
address.state = 'FL'
address.zip = '32250'
address.phone_number = '877 885 8846'
contact.addresses = [address]

collection.save(contact)
</coderay>
</notextile>

We can query using the powerful mongoDB query syntax, and have it return Ruby objects:

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
results = collection.find('addresses.state' => 'FL')
hashrocket = results.to_a.find {|contact| contact.name == 'Hashrocket'}
puts hashrocket.addresses.first.phone_number
</coderay>
</notextile>

Take a look in the examples directory for more code.

h2. Mapping Documents

MongoDoc provides ActiveRecord-like persistence, associations, named scopes, and validations (from "Validatable":http://github.com/durran/validatable) as well as a mongoDB query language (from "Mongoid":http://mongoid.org/home). MongoDoc also plays nicely with Rails.

@MongoDoc::Document@ provides all these features as a mixin.  A @MongoDoc::Document@ can either be a top-level mongoDB document, or an embedded document contained within a top-level document. Top-level documents are stored in collections named after their class: @Contact@ objects are stored in the 'contacts' collection (much like ActiveRecord).

Lets define a @Contact@ document with an @Address@ embedded document:

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
class Address
  include MongoDoc::Document

  key :street
  key :city
  key :state
  key :zip_code
  key :phone_number
end

class Contact
  include MongoDoc::Document

  key :name
  key :interests
  has_many :addresses

  named_scope :in_state, lambda {|state| {:where => {'addresses.state' => state}}}
end
</coderay>
</notextile>

Since a mongoDB document has no fixed schema, we define the composition of a document directly in our classes. Please note we do not specify types! We can also specify @has_one@ or @has_many@ associations.

Building and saving a document is easy:

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
contact = Contact.new(:name => 'Hashrocket', :interests => ['ruby', 'rails', 'agile'])
contact.addresses << Address.new(:street => '320 1st Street North, #712',
  :city => 'Jacksonville Beach',
  :state => 'FL',
  :zip_code => '32250',
  :phone_number => '877 885 8846')
contact.save
</coderay>
</notextile>

Now that we have some data, we can query using our named scope:

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
hashrocket = Contact.in_state('FL').find {|contact| contact.name == 'Hashrocket'}
</coderay>
</notextile>

And we can even perform partial updates:

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
hashrocket.addresses.first.update_attributes(:street => '320 First Street North, #712')
</coderay>
</notextile>

h2. Installation

MongoDoc *requires* mongoDB v1.3 or later.

bc. sudo gem install mongodoc

h2. Configuration

Configure your database connection in ./mongodb.yml, you do not need one if you are running on localhost with the default port

bc. name: test
host: localhost
port: 27017
options:
  auto_reconnect: true

You can change the location of the configuration file:

<notextile>
<coderay:ruby>
MongoDoc.config_path = './config/mongodb.yml'
</coderay>
</notextile>
