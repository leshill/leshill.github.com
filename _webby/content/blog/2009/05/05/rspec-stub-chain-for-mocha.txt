I am not at "RailsConf":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009 but I have been following the tweets of my coworkers, so I heard about ["RSpec":http://rspec.info]'s new @stub_chain@ method.  Since I prefer ["Mocha":http://mocha.rubyforge.org]'s syntax to that of the built-in RSpec stubbing framework, I created a monkey patch to add @stub_chain@ to Mocha:

gist107331.

Copy that into @spec/stub_chain_mocha.rb@ and then require it from @spec_helper.rb@.
