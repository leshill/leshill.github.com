I have been using "Hoptoad":http://hoptoadapp.com/ to track exceptions in my Rails apps for a while now.  The standard setup tracks exceptions in your controllers with a simple @include HoptoadNotifier::Catcher@ in your @application.rb@, easy!

However, I also wanted *Hoptoad* to track any exception which occurred in a cron job that was running with @script/runner@.  Again, a snap with *Hoptoad*, take a look:
