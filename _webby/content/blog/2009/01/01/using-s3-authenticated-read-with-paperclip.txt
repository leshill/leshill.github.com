"Paperclip"::http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/paperclip supports *AWS S3* with a default of _public-read_ access policy.  This allows anyone who knows the URL of the resource to access it.

For some applications, you might want a more restricted access policy.  The _authenticated-read_ access policy requires that the URL of the resource be presented by an authenticated user.

To use _authenticated-read_ with *Paperclip*:

* set the @:s3_permissions@ option on your attachment:

bc. :s3_permssions => 'authenticated-read'

* use @RightAws::S3Interface#get_link@ to generate an _authenticated-read_ URL for the attachment:

bc. def s3_url(style = nil, time_limit = 15.minutes)
  attachment.s3.interface.get_link(attachment.s3_bucket.to_s, attachment.path(style), time_limit)
end 

If you do not normally need to time limit the access, use @nil@ as the default value for @time_limit@
