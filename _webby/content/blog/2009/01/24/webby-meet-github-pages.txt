As of this post, this blog is now hosted by GitHub's recently announced "GitHub Pages":http://github.com/blog/272-github-pagesi, still "Webby":http://webby.rubyforge.org powered, now with extra _git_ goodness.

*GitHub Pages* generates a static site from a GitHub hosted repo, using "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll to generate the files.  *Jekyll* understands two special directories @_posts@ and @_layouts@, copying any other files and directories in the root of the repo that do not begin with an @_@ directly to the static site.

*Webby* generates a static site from set of source files (@content@, @layouts@, etc), placing the results in the @output_dir@ (defaults to @output@ but can be changed.)

To make *Webby* and *GitHub Pages* co-exist, I restructured my repo:

* The root of the repo is the @output_dir@ for *Webby*
* The *Webby* site (source files) are in a subdirectory name @_webby@
* The @webby@ command line tool should be run from within the @_webby@ directory, not the root of the repo
* The *Webby* @clobber@ target is overridden to ignore the @_webby@ directory

I had to make the following changes to my existing *Webby* site:

* A new @Sitefile@

gist51667.

* Found some code "here":http://www.taknado.com/2007/7/30/overriding-rake-tasks to allow overriding *Rake* tasks, this is @lib/override.rb@

gist51669.

* Redefined @clobber@ and created @clean_build@ task to allow for file deletions, this is @tasks/github_pages.rake@

gist51670.

The new workflow for adding a post to the new site is:

# Change directory to @_webby@
# Generate a new blog post
# Run @webby autobuild@
# Edit until completed
# Commit all changes locally (@git add .@ from the root)
# Push the changes
